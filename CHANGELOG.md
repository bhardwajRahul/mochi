# 📦 CHANGELOG.md

All notable changes to the Mochi programming language are documented in this file.

## [0.1.12] – 2025-05-18

### 🎉 Initial Developer Preview

Mochi v0.1.12 is the first developer preview release. It’s a small, statically typed language designed for clarity,
composability, and testability — ideal for intelligent tools, AI agents, and educational compilers.

### ✨ Language Features

- `let` bindings with static types (with type inference)
- Arithmetic, comparison, boolean logic
- `if` / `else` control flow
- Named functions and anonymous closures
- Currying and higher-order functions
- `for ... in ...` loops with integer ranges
- Expression-first syntax with return values
- Built-in `print(...)`

### 🧪 Testing

- `test "..." { ... }` blocks for inline testing
- `expect expr` assertions for golden tests
- Golden test runner with:
    - `make test` – run tests
    - `make update-golden` – update expected outputs

### ⚙️ Tooling and Developer Experience

- `mochi` CLI built with `go-arg`, supports:
    - `--run` to execute
    - `--ast` to print AST
    - `--version` to print build metadata
- `mochi-run` tool to generate:
    - `examples.md` – with source, AST, output
    - `llm.md` – source code listing for ingestion
    - `grammar.ebnf` – exported EBNF from parser
- Multiline comment support (`/* ... */`)
- Rich diagnostic engine with source position and suggestions
- Lisp-style AST formatting
- Colorful, emoji-enhanced Makefile DX:
    - `make build`, `make fmt`, `make lint`, `make clean`, etc.
- Auto-detect `golangci-lint`, fallback to `go vet`

### 🧱 Project Structure

- `cmd/mochi/` — CLI tool
- `cmd/mochi-run/` — doc/code generator
- `parser/` — lexer and recursive descent parser
- `ast/` — AST nodes, conversion, pretty-printer
- `types/` — type checker
- `interpreter/` — runtime evaluator
- `diagnostic/` — structured error reporting
- `examples/` — testable programs for golden tests

### 🔨 Internal Improvements

- Fully idiomatic Go style using standard libraries
- Testable components with minimal external dependencies
- Self-contained golden test framework
- Support for `Mochi` as a compiler backend or teaching tool
