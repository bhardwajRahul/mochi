# Mochi Language Roadmap

Mochi is a small, clean programming language built for clarity, composability, and agent-oriented design.
It is designed to evolve in small, focused stepsâ€”each version introduces one foundational concept, keeping the language
minimal but expressive.

This roadmap outlines the language development toward a stable 1.0, with an emphasis on first-class data types, control
flow, streaming logic, agents, and dataset support.

Current release: v0.3.0. Upcoming 0.3.x versions will focus on agents and datasets.

# v0.2.x â€“ Compose data types

## v0.2.11 â€“ Sets

- [ ]  Set literals
- [ ]  `in` operator
- [ ]  No duplicates
- [ ]  Basic set operations: insert, remove, union (future)

```
let seen = {"apple", "banana"}
if "apple" in seen {
  print("Already seen")
}
```

## v0.2.12 â€“ Tuples

- [ ]  Tuple literals
- [ ]  Tuple indexing via `.0`, `.1`
- [ ]  Destructuring (planned)
- [ ]  Nesting

```
let point = (10, 20)
let nameAndAge = ("Ada", 35)

print(point.0)       // 10
print(nameAndAge.1)  // 35
```

## v0.2.13 â€“ Struct Types

- [ ]  `type` declarations
- [ ]  Named field access via dot
- [ ]  Type annotation on variables
- [ ]  Nested structs

```
type User {
  name: string
  age: int
}

let u: User = {
  name: "Ana",
  age: 30
}

print(u.name)  // Ana
```

## v0.2.14 â€“ Block Expressions

- [ ]  `{}` blocks as expressions
- [ ]  Evaluate to last value
- [ ]  Nesting inside `let`, `return`, conditionals

```
let result = {
  let x = 2
  let y = 3
  x + y
}

print(result)  // 5
```

## v0.2.15 â€“ match Expressions

- [ ]  Pattern matching
- [ ]  Fallback case `_ =>`
- [ ]  Literal patterns
- [ ]  Destructuring (planned)

```
match value {
  0 => print("zero")
  1 => print("one")
  _ => print("other")
}

match user {
  { name: "Alice" } => print("Hi Alice")
  _ => print("Unknown")
}
```

## v0.2.16 â€“ Naive error Type

- [ ]  Union return types
- [ ]  `error` literal
- [ ]  `try` expression
- [ ]  `or` fallback

```
fun parse(x: string): int | error {
  if x == "" {
    return error "empty input"
  }
  return 42
}

let n = try parse("") or 0
print(n)  // 0
```

## v0.3 â€“ Streams

- [ ]  `stream` type declaration
- [ ]  `on` event handler syntax
- [ ]  Stream events with named fields
- [ ]  Type-safe field access
- [ ]  Runtime emit and dispatch
- [ ]  Support multiple handlers
- [ ]  Support multiple streams
- [ ]  Events queued and replayable
- [ ]  Declarative schema for events
- [ ]  Distinct stream name and type name
- [ ]  Streaming values from code
- [ ]  Optional timestamp field
- [ ]  Streaming into agents (in v0.4)

```
# Define a stream type named SensorReading
stream SensorReading {
  id: string
  temperature: float
  timestamp: time
}

# Listen to the stream using an `on` block
on SensorReading as r {
  print("Temp reading from", r.id)
  print("  â†’", r.temperature, "Â°C at", r.timestamp)
}

# You can also emit values into the stream at runtime (pseudo-syntax)
emit SensorReading {
  id: "sensor-1",
  temperature: 22.5,
  timestamp: now()
}

# Multiple on-handlers can be registered for the same stream
on SensorReading as r {
  if r.temperature > 30 {
    print("ðŸ”¥ High temperature alert!")
  }
}

# Streams are independent from agents (but will be integrated in v0.4)
# Events are queued and processed in order
```

## v0.4 â€“ Agents

- [ ]  `agent` block declaration
- [ ]  Internal `state` fields with initialization
- [ ]  `on` handlers for reacting to stream events
- [ ]  `intent` functions callable from outside
- [ ]  Local variable scoping inside agents
- [ ]  Mutable agent state with assignment
- [ ]  Deterministic execution (no shared memory)
- [ ]  Support for multiple agents
- [ ]  Agent lifecycle hooks (optional)
- [ ]  Support for `generate text` block using LLM
- [ ]  Automatic state snapshotting (future)
- [ ]  Integration with stream system (`on Stream as x` inside agent)

```
# Define a SensorReading stream as in v0.3
stream SensorReading {
  id: string
  temperature: float
  timestamp: time
}

# Define an agent with persistent state
agent Monitor {
  state {
    count: int = 0
    lastTemp: float = 0.0
  }

  # React to incoming stream events
  on SensorReading as r {
    count = count + 1
    lastTemp = r.temperature

    if r.temperature > 30 {
      print("ðŸ”¥ Temp warning for", r.id, ":", r.temperature)
    }
  }

  # Define an intent function that can be called externally
  intent status(): string {
    return "Readings seen: " + count + ", last = " + lastTemp
  }

  # Generate a natural language summary using an LLM
  intent summary(): string {
    return generate text {
      prompt: "The sensor has recorded $count readings. The last temperature was $lastTemp Â°C.",
      args: {
        count: count,
        lastTemp: lastTemp
      }
    }
  }
}

# This defines a reusable, autonomous computation unit.
# It has memory (state), reacts to the environment (on), and exposes capability (intent).
```

## v0.5 â€“ Datasets & Queries

- [ ]  `from "<file>"` syntax for loading datasets
- [ ]  Support for CSV, JSONL, Parquet (backend-dependent)
- [ ]  Row-oriented dataset model

- [ ]  `group by` and `having`
- [ ]  Expression support in `select` and `where`
- [ ]  Type inference from headers and values
- [ ]  Integration with agents and streams (read-only)
- [ ]  Deterministic, immutable datasets
- [ ]  Optional inline datasets (future)

```
# Load a dataset from CSV
let people = from "people.csv"

# Select a subset of rows
let adults = select name, age
from people
where age >= 18

# Join across multiple datasets
let purchases = from "purchases.parquet"
let customers = from "customers.jsonl"

let result = select p.id, c.name, p.amount
from purchases as p
join customers as c on p.customer_id == c.id
where p.amount > 100

# Aggregation and grouping
let summary = select city, count(*), avg(age)
from people
group by city
having count(*) > 10

# Expressions allowed in select
let short = select name, age * 2 as double_age
from people
where name != ""

# Datasets are immutable and queryable, like small in-memory tables.
# Future: support writing datasets with `write people to "people.jsonl"`
```

## v0.6 â€“ Modules & Imports

- [ ]  `import` statement for loading external modules
- [ ]  Support importing specific names or full module
- [ ]  Standard library modules (`math`, `time`, etc.)

print(x)  // 8

# Import only a single function
import time.now

let t = now()
print(t)

# Import with alias
import strings as str

let s = "hello"
print(str.upper(s))  // "HELLO"

# Import from a relative path
import "./utils/format"

print(format.debug(42))

# Module contents can include:
# - fun definitions
# - type declarations
# - agent declarations
# - streams
# - constants
# - datasets (via `from`)

    total = total + i.amount
  }

  intent get_summary(): string {
    return generate text {
      prompt: "The total billed amount is $total USD.",
      args: { total: total }
    }
  }
}

# Run test simulation with golden output
test "billing logic" {
  emit Invoice { amount: 50 }
  emit Invoice { amount: 20 }

  expect BillingWorker.total == 70
  expect BillingWorker.get_summary() contains "70"
}
