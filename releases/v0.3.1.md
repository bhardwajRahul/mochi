# June 2025 (v0.3.1)

Mochi v0.3.1 expands the generative features introduced in v0.3.0. Structured results can now be produced directly from `generate` blocks and custom struct types are first-class citizens. Requests accept flexible parameters for fine-grained control over model behaviour.

## Structured Generation

- `generate Type { ... }` executes an LLM request and decodes the JSON response into the given struct.
- The interpreter infers a JSON schema from the type and sends it via `response_format` to improve accuracy.

## Parameterized Options

- Fields like `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens` and `stop` may be supplied in `generate` blocks.
- Additional parameters are forwarded through the runtime using `llm.WithParam`.

## User-defined Struct Types

- `type` declarations introduce named structs with typed fields.
- Struct literals construct values and nested field selectors are type checked.

## Tooling Updates

- The Python compiler supports `test` blocks and `expect` statements.
- LLM provider structs include JSON tags and honour the `ResponseFormat` option.
- The cheatsheet has been updated with new generation examples.
