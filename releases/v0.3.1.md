# Jun 2025 (v0.3.1)

Mochi v0.3.1 expands on the generative AI foundation introduced in v0.3.0 by adding **first-class support for
user-defined types** and **structured AI output generation**. Programs can now declare their own rich types, instantiate
them manually, or populate them dynamically using AI-generated responses.

This release further emphasizes Mochi’s commitment to clarity, composability, and deep integration with modern AI
workflows.

## New Language Feature: User-Defined Types

You can now declare **custom struct-like types** using the `type` keyword. These types group related fields under a
named structure, enabling safer and more expressive programs.

### Example

```mochi
type Person {
  name: string
  age: int
  email: string
}

type Book {
  title: string
  author: Person
  pages: int
  tags: list<string>
  metadata: map<string, string>
  published: bool
}
```

### Usage

Declared types can be used to declare variables, construct values, and access fields:

```mochi
let bob: Person = Person {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 42,
  email: "bob@ex.com"
}

let book: Book = Book {
  title: "Example",
  author: bob,
  pages: 100,
  tags: ["guide"],
  metadata: { "isbn": "123" },
  published: true
}

print("custom types defined")
print(book.author.name)
```

### Features

* ✅ Full support for nested structs, lists, and maps
* ✅ Inline value construction using `{ field: value, ... }` syntax
* ✅ Type-annotated variables (`let x: Person`)
* ✅ Field access with dot notation (`x.field`)

This forms the foundation for composable data modeling, JSON-like transformations, and generative type synthesis.

## New Language Feature: `generate <Type>`

Building on user-defined types, you can now use LLMs to synthesize structured data directly:

```mochi
let p = generate Person {
  prompt: "Generate a fictional software engineer with name, age, and email."
}
```

Mochi parses the returned JSON and validates it against the declared `Person` type. All fields must be present and match
their expected types.

### Example

```mochi
type Person {
  name: string
  age: int
  email: string
}

let p = generate Person {
  prompt: "Generate a fictional software engineer"
}

print("Name:",  p.name)
print("Age:",   p.age)
print("Email:", p.email)
```

## Error Handling

Mochi validates the LLM’s response against your type. If a required field is missing or the structure doesn't match,
you’ll receive a detailed runtime error with a diff.

## Prompt Composition and Functions

All prompt text is fully dynamic:

```mochi
fun describe(topic: string): Book {
  generate Book {
    prompt: "Generate a book about " + topic
  }
}
```

## Runtime Configuration

As in v0.3.0, the LLM backend is defined via environment variables:

| Variable       | Description                                     |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | Provider name (e.g., `openai`, `echo`, `local`) |
| `LLM_DSN`      | Connection string or API base URL               |
| `LLM_MODEL`    | Default model name                              |

Structured and text generation both use this shared configuration.

## Testing and Snapshot Support

`generate` blocks integrate with Mochi’s test system. Use `expect` assertions to snapshot structured output:

```mochi
test "generate book" {
  let book = generate Book {
    prompt: "Create a guidebook named 'Mochi Language'"
  }

  expect book.title == "Mochi Language"
}
```

Run `mochi test --update` to re-record the generated output.

Mochi v0.3.1 makes typed programming and generative AI first-class citizens — setting the stage for upcoming agent,
stream, and task modeling features in the next release.
