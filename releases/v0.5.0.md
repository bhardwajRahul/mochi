# Jun 2025 (v0.5.0)

Mochi v0.5.0 introduces **agents** along with enhanced string handling and control flow. Agents keep persistent state, expose intent functions and react to events from streams. Strings can be indexed, iterated and checked for containment. A new `while` statement rounds out loop constructs.

## Agents

```mochi
agent Monitor {
  var count: int = 0

  on Sensor as s {
    count = count + 1
  }

  intent status(): string {
    return "events = " + str(count)
  }
}
```

Agents integrate with the runtime so external callers can invoke intents while events trigger handlers deterministically.

## Strings and Loops

Treat strings like lists of characters:

```mochi
for ch in "hello" {
  print(ch)
}
print("e" in "hello")
```

Use `while` for conditional loops when ranges do not apply.

## Other Changes

- Go, Python and TypeScript compilers updated for agents, strings and `while`
- Basic agent runtime with interpreter integration
- Example solutions and documentation updates
- Fixed a race condition in the agent runtime
