# Jun 2025 (v0.3.3)

Mochi v0.3.3 adds **pattern matching** and **logical operators**, expanding the language's expressiveness for control flow and boolean logic.

## Pattern Matching

A new `match` expression evaluates a target value against a series of patterns and returns the result of the first match. An underscore `_` matches any remaining cases.

```mochi
let label = match x {
  1 => "one"
  2 => "two"
  _ => "other"
}
```

Match expressions can appear anywhere an expression is allowed, including inside functions and variable declarations.

## Logical Operators

Boolean expressions now support `&&` (and) and `||` (or) with proper precedence.

```mochi
if a && b || c {
  print("combined condition")
}
```

These operators integrate with the type checker and interpreter just like other binary operators.
