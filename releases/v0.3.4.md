# Jun 2025 (v0.3.4)

Mochi v0.3.4 introduces **tool calling**, **union types**, and **inline methods**, enabling richer integrations and more expressive type definitions.

## Tool Calling

`generate` blocks can now invoke registered tools. Each tool may include a `description` used by the LLM when deciding to call it.

```mochi
fun getWeather(city: string): string {
  return "Clear"
}

let reply = generate text {
  prompt: "Weather in Paris?"
  tools: [
    getWeather { description: "Lookup current weather" }
  ]
}
```

## Union Types

Programs may declare algebraic data types using the `type A = ... | ...` syntax. Pattern matching integrates seamlessly with these unions.

```mochi
type Tree =
  Leaf
  | Node(left: Tree, value: int, right: Tree)

let total = match someTree {
  Leaf => 0
  Node(l, v, r) => v + total(l) + total(r)
}
```

## Inline Methods

Struct types can embed function members that act as methods:

```mochi
type Circle {
  radius: float

  fun area(): float {
    return 3.14 * radius * radius
  }
}
```

## Other Changes

- Tool descriptions exported in JSON schemas
- Examples extended with method and binary tree demos
- Fixed several issues around tool call handling
