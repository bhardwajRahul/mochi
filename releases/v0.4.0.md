# Jun 2025 (v0.4.0)

Mochi v0.4.0 introduces asynchronous **streams** for declarative event processing. Programs can define stream types, emit events, and handle them with `on` blocks. The runtime queues events and executes handlers deterministically.

## Streams

```mochi
stream Sensor { id: string, temperature: float }

on Sensor as s {
  print(s.id, s.temperature)
}

emit Sensor { id: "sensor-1", temperature: 22.5 }
```

## Other Changes

- Refactored stream runtime with interfaces
- Go, Python and TypeScript compiler support
- Async interpreter handlers
- Updated syntax highlighting for keywords
