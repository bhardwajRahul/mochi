# June 2025 (v0.3.0)

This big release introduces event streams, persistent agents and LLM powered text generation. Mochi becomes far more capable for building intelligent, reactive systems.

## Streams

Events are now first‑class. Declare stream types with `stream` and handle them using `on` blocks. Events can be `emit`ted at runtime and queued for reliable delivery.

## Agents

`agent` blocks encapsulate state and expose `intent` functions. Agents react to stream events and maintain their own private data using the `state` section. This lays the groundwork for long‑running, autonomous programs.

## Generate Text

`generate text` integrates large language models directly into Mochi code. The runtime supports multiple providers and can stream responses back to your program.

## MCP and Tooling

The MCP server reports version 0.3.0 and logs full errors. The cheatsheet and specification have been updated to match the new language features.
