# Mochi VS Code Extension

This folder contains a Visual Studio Code extension for the Mochi programming language. It bundles the TextMate grammar from `mochi-tm` and provides a simple "Hello, World" command.

## Building

Install dependencies and build the extension:

```bash
npm install
npm run package
```

The command above produces `mochi-0.1.0.vsix` which can be installed in VS Code via the Extensions view.
